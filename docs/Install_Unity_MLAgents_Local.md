# Installing Unity ML-Agents in Local Machine

## Install miniconda and Python
Install `miniconda` by following the steps in https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/

Once installed, create and activate a conda environment.

```
# create conda environment and install python 3.10.12
conda create -n ml-agents-rel-21_python-3.10.12 python=3.10.12

# activate created environment
conda activate ml-agents-rel-21_python-3.10.12
```

Upgrade PIP and verify installed versions.

```
# Upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Confirm versions
python --version
pip --version
pip3 --version
```

## Install Unity ML Agent

![mlagents-dependencies.png](../images%2Fmlagents-dependencies.png)

Several ways to install ML-Agents. Cloning the repository is the recommended way.
https://unity-technologies.github.io/ml-agents/Installation/#clone-the-ml-agents-toolkit-repository-recommended

Clone `ml-agents` on branch `release_21`.
```
git clone --branch release_21 https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents.git ml-agents-release_21
```

There is a bug in `release_21` branch on `Numpy`.

```
setup.py:63: RuntimeWarning: NumPy 1.21.2 may not yet support Python 3.10.‚Äù
```

This is fixed in the `develop` branch, but it's better to use the `release` branch. [Issue 6008](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/6008)

A workaround to this issue is updating `"numpy==1.21.2"` to `"numpy==1.23.3"` in the file
`/ml-agents-envs/setup.py`

To install the `mlagents` Python package run these commands.
Also see [Installing ML-Agents]([https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/6008](https://unity-technologies.github.io/ml-agents/Installation/#installing-mlagents))

```
# go to the repo root directory
cd /ml-agents-release_21

# install dependencies
python -m pip install ./ml-agents-envs
python -m pip install ./ml-agents

# then test
mlagents-learn --help
```

This will install `mlagents` from the cloned repository, not from the PyPi repository.
If you installed this correctly, you should be able to run `mlagents-learn --help`, after which
you will see the command line parameters you can use with `mlagents-learn`.

## Install ML-Agents Unity Package in Unity Package Manager

```
NOTE: Steps copied from https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/develop/com.unity.ml-agents/Documentation~/com.unity.ml-agents.md  
This is better for sharing the repository as there is no dependency on local ml-agent repository.
Note this is a Unity package, and different from the ML-Agents learn from the previous section
```

In `Unity 2019.4` or later, open the `Package Manager`, hit the `"+"` button, and select `"Add package from git URL"`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../images/unity_package_manager_git_url.png" width="300px"/>
</p>

In the dialog that appears, enter the following

```
git+https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents.git?path=com.unity.ml-agents#release_21

(...AND OPTIONAL extensions)
git+https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents.git?path=com.unity.ml-agents.extensions#release_21
```

You can also edit your project's `manifest.json` directly and add the following line to the `dependencies` section:

```
"com.unity.ml-agents": "git+https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents.git?path=com.unity.ml-agents#release_21",
```

## Setting up Pytorch (Deep Learning Framework)

Starting from this point, including the next installation steps, make sure you are using
the created conda environment in the earlier steps before running the next command.

Run `conda env list` and the selected environment must be `ml-agents-rel-21_python-3.10.12`

Run this command to install `Pytorch v1.13.1`.

```
pip3 install torch~=1.13.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```
