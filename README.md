# Getting Started
There are two ways to train and run the Reinforced Machine training environment.

1. **(Recommended)** In Google Colab where all the needed dependencies will be installed and pull the
latest Reinforced Machine Training Linux build.

2. Train it locally. Here you need to setup Unity ML Agents `Release 21` and install
Pytorch along with all its dependencies.
